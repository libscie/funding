## Tell us about the world as you see it.

Society is running on fumes --- figuratively and literally.

There is nothing natural about the systems we build as people, yet we are often told it is “just the way things are” or “business as usual.”

As a result, we are running rampant into a climate crisis and [increasing social inequality](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/01/1055681).

With the corona pandemic, “business as usual” is gone, together with some of its arbitrary quirks (e.g., commutes) and necessities (e.g., childrearing services). This disruption instigates action potential for imagining and building different futures altogether.

At the same time, the economic effects of the [Great Lockdown](https://blogs.imf.org/2020/04/14/the-great-lockdown-worst-economic-downturn-since-the-great-depression/) threaten those futures by making our world more unequal — [just like previous epidemics such as SARS and MERS did](https://blogs.imf.org/2020/05/11/how-pandemics-leave-the-poor-even-farther-behind/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery).

We can only change our everyday lives and build the world around us if we have the resources to do so — more inequality means fewer people have those resources. Those with the resources, the beneficiaries of inequality, are also most alienated from the many without resources, potentially creating new issues for us when they try to address theirs.

## **What change do you want to make in the world?**

I am a scientist and experienced firsthand how academic systems cause everyday issues — power abuses, selective publishing, exclusive access, nepotism.

The resources to challenge those issues are unequally distributed throughout academia as well. I tried reforming that system from within for half a decade, but was put aside as too inexperienced to understand. Yet, minor and limited successes were also those that received the approval of those with resources.

That I was only allowed to make change when those with the resources approved it, convinced me that my energy was better spent conscientiously building from the outside, creating systems that produce and distribute resources more equitably itself. This helps the people involved to work towards a world they want to see.

To that end, I am creating two new systems — to (1) address issues in the everyday lives of scientists and (2) to address issues in the everyday lives of workers.

A key result of my PhD research was that the "after-the-fact" publication system is at the root of quite a few of the research issues in academia. I want to change how work is communicated and initiate and grow "as-you-go" communication, which results in near real time publishing of each step of research. This will bake in open access, researcher controlled publishing, complete reporting, and continuous review of research.

I also want organisations to provide people with time, money, agency, and energy—vital resources to act on imagined futures. To that end, I am implementing the first Open Worker Cooperative (OWC), a blueprint for a healthier work environment owned by the workers.

## **What are you going to do to get there?**

In year 1 of my Fellowship, I founded Liberate Science as a for-profit in Germany, found a full-time team of three (operations, design, engineering) that signed on to the vision of Liberate Science and the Open Worker Cooperative (OWC), and implemented three of the four pillars of the OWC:

1. Four day workweeks
2. Uniform base pay (net 2000 EUR/month)
3. Democratic decision making

We cooperatively built the first implementation of the "as-you-go" publishing system (i.e., Hypergraph), together with a community of innovators (~40 people).

Year 2 starts with a production version of Hypergraph and will result in the realisation of the first OWC. This means the implementation of the final of the four pillars, budgetary profit sharing, and formally giving each worker partnership with equal voting rights in the organisation.

Budgetary profit sharing is the pay-it-forward mechanism of my Shuttleworth Fellowship. It distributes profits equally to all workers in the form of a company budget to build their futures. If another for-profit organisation is created with this budget, it must be created according to the OWC blueprint, with this same pay-it-forward mechanism.

In order to build profits that can be shared, I will focus on cooperatively implementing services in Hypergraph that are based on the value they provide to the researcher and do not obstruct usage of the as-you-go publishing system. We have multiple concrete business models to start generating revenue, from archival services for published content to selling replication materials for studies through vendor referrals. At the end of the fellowship, I will have built revenue streams covering 50.1% of Liberate Science's operating budget.

## **What challenges or uncertainties do you expect to face?**

A challenge is finding a balance between increasing liquidity for project growth and not relinquishing ownership. Academic funding is often not available to for-profit organisations or requires an administrative machinery we do not have; venture capital funding requires giving up part of the ownership of the organisation, going against the OWC mission. I am uncertain about whether there will come a moment where I will have to choose between Liberate Science and the OWC, where the success of the former to me is dependent on the success of the latter.

I feel a strong sense of responsibility to consider the path dependencies of choices during the institutionalisation of this vision, as I am hyper-aware of potential unintended consequences down the line. My challenge in dealing with that has shown me how personal running this organisation is—I continuously need to overcome my self-ascribed sense of responsibility and actively involve the team to cooperatively create our, ultimately, shared vision. It has exposed some of my personal uncertainties as hurdles for organisation growth.

Everyday, I am uncertain about whether the business models we are developing within Liberate Science will allow it to become a self-sustaining business. I see it as a large challenge to start the sales side of the project, in order to make this open project financially sustainable in an ethical way, such that the OWC may proliferate.

## **What part does openness play in your idea?**

I have actively fought for open practices since 2012, extending from specific instances like equitable access to scientific publications to the equitable organisation model that I am building now.

Nonetheless, where I first saw open as freedom of information, I now know that my true meaning of open is inclusive communities and cooperation among those in that community. That openness requires an amount of vulnerability to jointly face challenges and jointly make decisions, instead of going at it alone and bearing the sole responsibility to make decisions. The pandemic has showcased this in our team as well.

The importance of community comes from a deep gratitude for what the open community has meant to me over the years. We all struggle from issue to issue, feeling like we cannot have a meaningful impact. I know how much mental energy that feeling drains; the community has given me energy and support to keep building and I hope to contribute to this collective effort.

I think the values I outline for an Open Worker Cooperative realises this by giving everyone involved in the project a say in the process, and requiring cooperation by distributing control and resources, with pay-it-forward mechanisms to further grow that community.
