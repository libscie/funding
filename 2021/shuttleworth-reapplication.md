# Shuttleworth reapplication Chris Hartgerink (Year 3)

## Tell us about the world as you see it.

It is no longer obvious that the next generation will have it better than the last.

The climate crisis threatens an entire generation and whole ecosystems. Social progress is stagnating and even regressing. How can we have it better, if we build worse?

As a scientist, I see how we are building knowledge systems that leave it worse for the next generation. Market concentration in publishing. Careers built on systems that promote a natural selection of bad science. Fiscal austerity that pits researchers against each other to compete for excellence. How can we understand and improve the world, if we build worse knowledge systems?

I see the world through a lens of hopeless optimism: Believing in the courage to build and unlock better systems. Not to sit in the privilege of simply hoping it will become better, but to go through the struggle of trying to build better - even if we end up learning we struggled for the wrong thing for a moment.

## What change do you want to make in the world?

As a scientist who experienced issues of the current knowledge system directly, I want to build better ways to produce and distribute knowledge.

I want scientists to be in control of what, where, when, and why they publish. During my doctoral research I had to publish in restrictive formats that didn't reflect my work (what), in journals that I did not agree with (where), with unnecessary delays (when), to pump up my CV (why). In the end, I concluded during my research that the "after-the-fact" nature of publications is where a lot of the issues come together.

I am building a better knowledge system, which is based on continuous publishing of research modules. Elsevier researchers first pitched this in 1998, where it seems to have gotten lost in the transition from analog articles to digital articles.

"As-you-go" publishing of works gives researchers the opportunity to publish formats not before possible (e.g., dynamic documents), in near realtime, to create opportunities for continuous collaboration with researchers of any background. With the current status of the internet, it also permits for automated publishing, with much potential to strengthen data sharing.

My vision is that continuous and automated publishing of research modules is conducive to a natural selection of good science because it embeds the chronology of events into the knowledge system, instead of abstracting it away. With the research process embedded in the way knowledge is published, it opens up a new dimension of knowledge that now remains unseen.

This also creates opportunities for markets that revolve around more effectively discovering, producing, and synthesising those new dimensions of knowledge - which can be built to further strengthen the natural selection of good science.

## What are you going to do to get there?

In year 1 of the Shuttleworth Fellowship, I founded Liberate Science as a for-profit vessel to harness the financial resources into building the infrastructure for this vision, the publishing of "as-you-go" research modules.

In year 2, together with the team, I launched the infrastructure and started the process of growing the number of researchers publishing in this "as-you-go" way. Nine months in, we are at 141 profiles and 41 published research steps. We launched a major research effort, the Many Paths project, to explore how deeply collaborations are affected by this way of publishing researchers (50 researchers signed up to this project). We are also becoming a reputable partner in building better knowledge systems.

In year 3, I will convert our reputation to build better knowledge systems into business opportunities for the organization. Our core vision has long-term business potential, and in order to bridge us into that period, I will create short- and medium-term business opportunities. In year 2, I started consulting for organizations like Science Magazine at a rate that, if extrapolated, requires 25% billable time to fund our entire operation. Other options include co-writing research grants for software engineering (already pending grants for 40,000EUR). This will sustain our work on the core vision beyond the Shuttleworth Fellowship.


## What challenges or uncertainties do you expect to face?

I am a scientist, yet increasingly I am doing work that is not science.

Sometimes I am uncertain about the path forward for me personally - do I want to ultimately go back to doing research, or do I want to stay at the helm of this organization I founded? The messy middle of founding and running an organization is a challenge for me on many days because I take this to heart.

My self-confidence has grown over the past years, but I am still uncertain about my business acumen. In recent months, I have grown my previously absent confidence to charge higher hourly rates, which builds my capacity to ask for the right price --- my challenge here is to keep building on that. Right now, I am personally struggling with a GDPR complaint, which is teaching me a lot on a personal and business level.

I want to challenge myself to share these learnings more openly - for building in open science is something not many people do. That kind of vulnerability, I would like to challenge myself with.

An uncertainty I face is about scale. I am now the primary responsibility holder for many key areas of the project. I am the founder, director, manager, bookkeeper, software developer, and scientist. I definitely did not utilise the funds optimally for year 2 - I recognise my challenge in finding the right people to include in the project to unlock a more effective use of my time resources. I have not been systematic about this before, as I am working through personal growth to do this in a way that is not only respectful to others, but also to myself. The uncertainty here is about articulating what that means in this context too - as I've learned that organisational growth requires personal growth.


## What part does openness play in your idea?

Openness to me has meant many things over the years, since I started considering it a core value in 2012. Regardless of its specific manifestation, open runs through the core of the vision.

I consider open access to knowledge a human right - and will put my skin in the game to ensure my work is open. I have been lauded and doubted for my decision to reject authorship on a Science paper, because it would not be open.

That same skin is in the game for this vision. I am willing to struggle for open in the shape of access, open in form of equity, and open in form of power distribution.

That also means that I bring open to the questions of building an organisation - what do the open values result in when determining profit distribution? What does it mean in setting wages? These are the kinds of decisions that help institutionalise the values of open, which is how important openness is to me in this project.
