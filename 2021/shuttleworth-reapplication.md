# Shuttleworth reapplication Chris Hartgerink (Year 3)

## Tell us about the world as you see it.

The systems we build as people are not natural, yet we are often told it is "just the way things are," "business as usual," and to attempt to "change things from within". 

Systems are intentional --- active, breathing, forceful. They gaslight us to believe they are natural in order to preserve themselves. Like a tsunami, these systems cannot be stopped at the coast when they are about to hit us. To mend the effects, we need to forcefully, actively, and with a long breath repair the systems to create something substantively different.

I am a researcher and I experienced firsthand the forcefulness of  existing knowledge systems, when I attempted to make seemingly logical improvements --- to reduce a career ladder that promotes natural selection of bad science and exclusive access; to promote a culture that builds people up instead of breaking them down. This led to mental health issues for myself, when my naivety was met with this intentional system.

In that situation, I desired the agency to make a change in our knowledge systems. It also helped me realize that everyday, people everywhere experience issues in their daily lives and have ideas to change their systems. 

I am convinced people can unlock a better world, if they have the resources (time, energy, agency, money) to struggle for it. Yet, with increasing social and financial inequity, ever fewer have those resources.

## What change do you want to make in the world?

As a scientist, I want to repair our broken knowledge systems. I experienced these issues firsthand - exclusive access, power abuses, selective publishing, nepotism, to name a few.

I tried reforming these systems from within for half a decade, but was put aside as inexperienced. Minor and limited successes required the approval of those with resources.

Based on my research findings, I unlocked a different knowledge system. In it, "after-the-fact" publications are regarded as the root of many research issues in academia, and is transformed into "as-you-go" communication of research steps. This results in near real time, continuous publishing, that bakes in open access, researcher controlled publishing, complete reporting, and continuous review of research.

By enacting this change, there's also the opportunity to create a pay-it-forward ecosystem in which more and more people get the resources to enact their change. In this pay-it-forward ecosystem:

1. resources are used to grow the number of people working on changing (knowledge) systems together
2. which leads to repairing (knowledge) systems
3. which leads to valuable improvements
4. which leads to opportunities to convert the value from those improvements into financial value
5. which leads to financial resources to invest
6. which leads to more financial resources (on average)
7. See 1

## What are you going to do to get there?

In year 1, I founded Liberate Science as a for-profit in Germany. With the time, energy, money, and agency I received from the Shuttleworth Foundation, I initiated the repairs and grew the people working on repairing knowledge systems (step 1 of the ecosystem). 

I started paying forward resources by implementing a four-day workweek (time and energy), decent living pay for all employees involved in the repairs regardless of role (net 2000EUR/month; money), and democratic management of the organization (agency).

In year 2, we released the "as-you-go" knowledge system, implementing an open infrastructure that bakes in access, complete reporting, and researcher controlled publishing (step 2). 141 people have signed up to these repairs and published 48 research steps (step 3).

In year 3, I will grow the scale of the repairs and unlock step 4: Converting change value into financial value. This raises key questions: What is the experienced value of these repairs? What opportunities does that give? At the same time, steps 1 through 3 of the ecosystem will continue to receive energy to improve the momentum, which will provide more opportunities to find ways to produce and convert value.

Beyond year 3, I will keep growing the pay-it-forward ecosystem to amplify my work, and others'. Year 3 will be about ensuring the ecosystem is healthy enough to continue on its own feet after the Shuttleworth Fellowship ends. This way, I can keep making repairs to knowledge systems in the future.

## What challenges or uncertainties do you expect to face?

The pay-it-forward ecosystem I presented is a model, and the practicalities prove challenging to my training as a scientist.

A challenge is growing my skills in creating business opportunities at the right price. In recent months, I have grown my previously absent confidence to charge higher hourly rates, which builds my capacity to ask for the right price. 

Now, I need to learn how to produce the business opportunities where I can get those rates. This means I will need to more actively develop and enact a business and sales strategy. Again, as a scientist, this is a definite challenge to retool myself for this purpose.

An uncertainty I face is about scale. I am now primary responsibility holder for many key areas of the project. I am the founder, director, manager, bookkeeper, software developer, and scientist. I need to find the right people to include in the project to unlock a more effective use of my time resources. I have not been systematic about this before, as I am working through personal growth to do this in a way that is not only respectful to others, but also to myself. The uncertainty here is about articulating what that means in this context too - as I've learned that organizational growth requires personal growth.

## What part does openness play in your idea?

I have actively fought for open practices since 2012, extending from specific instances like equitable access to scientific publications to the equitable organisation model that I am building now.

In what is now almost a decade, how I view open evolved. Where I first saw open as freedom of information, second as inclusivity and cooperation, I now see it as radical equity. 

It represents people power --- the capability for people to collectively use or delegate their own power to set the agenda, participate in the dialogue that results in proposals, and consent to the outcomes.

Openness to me is the idea that through deliberation, we can come to better outcomes together than alone. This does not mean everybody has to participate, it requires clear definition of scope. Openness to me is a form of collectiveness, that recognises we exist through other people, and embraces it.

Openness is a hard but rewarding thing to me personally, as it continuously requires to judge, reflect, and learn how our actions affect other people. I am by nature an inward facing person, and openness is how I connect with people.
